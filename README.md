# InvoiceMaker

### This program can be used to create invoices in the form of a .pdf file. It was specifically created to work in the shipment industry.

It was coded in Java with the use of the JavaFX 11, itextpdf-5.5.13.2, jackson-annotations-2.12.3, jackson-core-2.12.3, and jackson-databand-2.12.3 libraries.

The program allows a user to store information about their own company in the _Edit Info_ tab. For example, their name, address, contact information, logo, and slogan. The user can also add shippers, brokers, and receivers, through their respective tabs. In the _Create Invoice_ tab, the user can create an invoice by entering the required information. In the table, invoice items can be added. Finally, the user can click the "Create Invoice" button and can select a destination for the .pdf file.

The program also stores all the invoices the user has created and allows the user to open them through the program. This feature can be accessed via the _Past Invoices_ tab.
